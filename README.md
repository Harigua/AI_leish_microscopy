The AIR-LEISH dataset is a curated collection of Giemsa-stained microscopy images of intracellular Leishmania amastigotes within infected macrophages. 

This dataset was generated using two complementary in vitro infection models. The first model involves THP-1-derived macrophages infected with L. major parasites. The second model used primary human monocyte-derived macrophages infected with L. infantum parasites.

In both cases, infections were conducted under controlled experimental conditions and imaged using standard light microscopes. 

All images were manually annotated by experts to indicate the location of intracellular amastigotes, host cells and nuclei. 

The dataset was then structured into training, validation, and test sets. 

Annotations were provided in a format that enables the training of deep learning models for object detection, and for segmentation. 

We trained the YOLO8 and U-Net models to detect and count amastigotes within the images was performed. 

The dataset is publicly and freely available on the Kaggle platform.
